        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **function** is defined outside a class, and a **method** is defined inside a class and works on objects.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Function → `len([1,2,3])`\n",
        "Method → `\"hello\".upper()`\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Parameters** are the names in the function definition, and **arguments** are the actual values passed.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "`def add(a,b):` → `a,b` = parameters\n",
        "`add(3,5)` → `3,5` = arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Functions can be defined using `def` or `lambda`.\n",
        "They can be called by writing the function name followed by parentheses.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "`def fun(): print(\"hi\")`\n",
        "`fun()`\n",
        "Lambda → `(lambda x: x+1)(5)`\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "\n",
        "`return` gives the output of a function and ends the function.\n",
        "Example:\n",

        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        "An **iterator** can be used with `next()` and remembers its state; an **iterable** can be looped over but does not remember state.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "`iter([1,2,3])` → iterator\n",
        "`[1,2,3]` → iterable\n",

        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are functions that use `yield` to produce values one at a time.\n",

        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators use less memory and are faster for large data because they produce values one by one.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Iterating over `range(10**9)` (generator) uses almost no memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        "A lambda is a small anonymous function used for short tasks.\n",

        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "`map()` applies a function to each item of a sequence.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "`map(str, [1,2,3])` → `[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"]`\n",

        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "`map()` transforms items, `filter()` selects items, and `reduce()` combines items into one value.\n",
